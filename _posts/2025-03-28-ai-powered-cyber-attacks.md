#  How Hackers Are Weaponizing AI

Recent studies show **a 1350% increase** in AI-generated phishing attacks since ChatGPT's release. Here's what developers need to know:

## Top 3 AI Attack Vectors
1. **Hyper-Personalized Phishing**  
   - Attackers use AI to analyze your GitHub commits and craft convincing fake emails:  
     ```python
     # Example of AI-generated pretext
     "Hi [Name], I noticed a bug in your commit #a1b2c3. 
     Here's a patch: maliciouslink.io/urgent-fix.py"
     ```

2. **Automated Malware Development**  
   - Tools like WormGPT create polymorphic code that evades detection:  
     ```bash
     # AI-generated obfuscation example
     exec(__import__('base64').b64decode('aW1wb3J0IG9z...'))
     ```

3. **Deepfake Voice Bypassing MFA**  
   - CEO impersonations now use 3-second voice clones (Microsoft's VASA-1 demo)

## Defense Strategies
### For Developers:
```yaml
# GitHub Actions hardening example
- name: Scan for AI-generated threats
  uses: action/ghast@v2
  with:
    targets: '*.py,*.js'
    check_for: 'ai_malware_patterns'
